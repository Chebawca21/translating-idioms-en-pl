What I am saying in both these points about PLOTEUS and access to the net is: by all means think about opportunities in space, but bring this portal down to earth so that it connects with real people on more occasions.
Although we should fully recognise the importance of alternative energy sources and their possible dominating role in the future, we should nevertheless develop a down-to-earth approach to nuclear energy and face the fact that 30% of the energy produced in the EU is produced by nuclear power plants.
We polished it somewhat in 2005, when the new Lisbon Strategy was prepared, still ambitious, yet much more down to earth.
Ladies and gentlemen, following the Alliance of Civilisations, we must come down to earth and continue voting.
It ensures that EU money is spent on a project that is already being shown to deliver positive results in many Member States, and it is a practical, down-to-earth, workable proposal.
As previous speakers have said, this Parliament has a duty to bring down to earth the Commission's very generous and very altruistic proposals.
Recent years have seen an increase in the number of products that contain hazardous substances or pose a risk: Chinese toys are merely the tip of the iceberg.
The state of emergency declared by General Musharraf on the third day, a crack in Pakistan's constitution, is just the tip of the iceberg, which we gave warning about here in July and October.
Let me say that when it comes to treatment of the Slovak minority, this act is only the tip of the iceberg.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that the main producer countries of wheat and maize have lost more than 80% of their original varieties, and these figures are just the tip of the iceberg, for we know that to date, only around 1.7 million of the world's estimated 13 million living species have been identified and described.
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
Let me say this: we will have many other issues to argue about, for CO2 emissions are just the tip of the iceberg.
It is the tip of the iceberg based partly on the collapse of fundamental moral principles and partly on human naïvety.
Somalia is only the tip of the iceberg.
This is, of course, just the tip of the iceberg, because we should also address human traffickers, networks that provide support to illegal immigrants and also, of course, Member State governments that legalise illegal aliens on a massive scale.
I would like the European Commission too to be aware of the complexity of the situation, because if it is not taken into account frustration will build up and a political populism will take root in our country.
What fills me with apprehension, however, is the thought that this attitude is taking root in such a way here in Parliament that some Members are seeking to put the most trivial pragmatic considerations before the most basic of principles.
My message is therefore 'Do not let it take root!'
Under these conditions - in marginalised sections of society or in social strata with a low level of political awareness and experience - far-right and fascist ideas, which are promoted under a populist, demagogic guise, are able to take root.
It is the history of how moral will took root in the institutions and transformed the old political paradigms.
Otherwise the suspicion could take root that the priorities have been chosen because you want to get rid of the inconvenient infringements.
That is why we must make far more of an effort to ensure that lasting democracy, the rule of law and good governance take root in Africa.
It was back in the 1990s, when Socialist governments were in power, that this development took root.
Sacred cows will have to be sacrificed, including those surrounding longer heavier vehicles, for example, or the proliferation of driving bans in the European Union, the sacred cows over cabotage, and so on and so forth.
It is little short of tragic that this House is constantly speaking about freedom and human rights whilst imposing the severest, most drastic muzzling rules on people who have differing opinions on the matter and, for example, do not simply join the rest of this House in worshipping the sacred cow of the proverbial multicultural society.
We can take action before the problem gets out of hand, and this is one of the most important aspects of this strategy.
We must act vigorously if we do not want things to get out of hand here.
It is about drawing lessons from the financial crises and developments in the finance industry that get out of hand and are no longer compatible with an adequate macroeconomy.
Mr President, well, we are supposed to stay cool when following a debate, but this debate has got out of hand and it has literally gone with the wind, and with it has gone honesty and rationalism.
Again, I quote Jean-Claude Trichet: 'Banking watchdogs should not have disproportionate requirements regarding credit agencies', and, on the other hand, according to Jean-Claude Juncker: 'Everything must be done to prevent salaries from getting out of hand'.
Moreover, the current threshold for mobilising the fund is, as you said, Mrs Hübner, extremely high, which means that the derogations are getting out of hand.
In short, we require consistent policy choices that combine solidarity and responsibility, enabling us to offer a balanced response to an emergency that is otherwise in danger of getting out of hand.
Only in this way can we avoid the costs of this crisis getting out of hand.
In praising this package I must agree with my Scottish - if not political - colleague, Mr Stevenson, in pointing to the elephant in the room that is the poor prices that farmers still have to endure, because the supply chain is beyond breaking point and too many of those involved in the market are abusing their position.
As the Commissioner says, the health check is a good opportunity, because until the EU takes action to tackle that elephant in the room, all the good efforts like this package will continue to be overshadowed and lose out in the noise.
As there do not seem to be major differences in our opinion on the milk mini-package, I would take the opportunity to use my final comments on the 'elephant in the room'.
We have become so obsessed with global warming that we have overlooked the real elephant in the room - the global food crisis.
However, the unspoken-of elephant in the room is that, whereas Lisbon cannot go ahead without 27 Member States' approval, the EU can find ways for a coalition of the willing to move on.
If they simply pay lip service to the directive, the Commission will have no way of forcing them into it.
There is no point in paying lip-service to disabled people's rights.
Or, does it mean that Poland and the British Government simply pay lip-service to those values but then deny their citizens the means to enforce their rights?
However, Commissioner, I regret that the reference to the parliamentary dimension was mere lip service, for none of the requests we made at the previous summit in relation to specific courses of action and funds to develop the role of the Parliaments were included in the summit's conclusions.
They must now prove in practice that they really mean business on fundamental rights, rather than just paying lip service to them.
There is no point in Member States paying lip-service to implementation, as many do in the field of health and safety, and then, quite often, calling for more legislation, even if the scientific and medical evidence does not establish a risk.
We are extremely concerned, not only by what is happening in my country, in Naples, but also because it seems to us that the lip service paid to the hierarchy of waste strategies, placing a priority on prevention and re-use, is actually contradicted by the text of this legislation, which once again gives priority to incinerators, which, in our view, are definitely not the only way of solving the waste problem.
For example, the Hungarian government, whilst paying lip service to climate protection measures, has postponed adoption of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for months.
Consequently, we can say quite bluntly that many Member States of the Union have only paid lip service to energy efficiency, thrift and the ultimate aim of a 'low-carbon society', so what future is there for an economy, households and transport with zero carbon dioxide emissions?
This is on condition, however, that the Small Business Act pays more than just lip service to SMEs.
A sound principle is the one paid lip-service in policy speeches but ignored in decision-making: the subsidiarity principle.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it seems that, once again, the Commission is merely paying lip service to the idea of a social Europe.
But paying lip-service to equality is not good enough.
Respect for the subsidiarity principle, which is often paid lip service but seldom applied, is conspicuous by its absence.
I think Parliament has rather missed the boat there, or should I say the train.
I urge the Council to adopt a joint action immediately and to set the final stages in motion so that we do not miss the boat on getting EU troops in where they are urgently required.
Mr El Khadraoui, I think you hit the nail on the head: we want to make this a political priority.
You hit the nail on the head: when I was small I almost died from breathing in the vapours emitted by grapes being trampled underfoot in a vat, so there is a close link between life and death.
I honestly believe that the Presidency's answer hit the nail on the head.
I think that European leaders should think twice before putting producers between a rock and a hard place.
They find themselves between a rock and a hard place.
In which case, I would urge those Members not to shed crocodile tears about the plight of certain migrants - and not to vote for fisheries agreements in this House and not to vote for the trade rules that devastate economies elsewhere.
The crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between Palestinians are really inappropriate after the European Union was incapable of supporting Mahmoud Abbas' efforts to co-opt the pragmatic wing of Hamas.
Cluster bombs are a factor in wars being waged by EU countries, for example in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, so please, let us not shed any crocodile tears here!
We award the Sakharov Prize to Mr Osman and we leave him alone to fight to defend the lives of millions of people in Darfur, we continue to ignore the violence of the Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia and we weep crocodile tears for the 50 victims in Algeria.
This disgraceful resolution does not even shed crocodile tears over poverty or social exclusion.
There is no point crying crocodile tears over deaths and humanitarian incidents when we do nothing to defend our coastline.
Better late than never!
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a saying that is well known in many countries: 'better late than never'.
We believe it has taken too long to do so, but better late than never.
We had waited some time for this to happen - a lot longer than in other countries, but better late than never.
But, as the saying goes, better late than never.
In Estonia we say: 'better late than never', and it is a positive development that we are finally passing the temporary agency worker directive.
The Descamps report will be a highlight of this legislature in terms of the relationship between cutting-edge technology and European culture through the ages.
For the sake of the planet, for the good of an industry that needs to stay at the cutting edge of world-class technology, it is time now for law-makers to steer them firmly in a greener direction.
If a third of old plants were replaced by cutting-edge facilities, fuel consumption could be reduced by 30%.
It stands to reason that the governments of individual countries and also the European Union should endeavour to support these areas of manufacture, in the hope that it might be possible to exploit the cutting edge solutions discovered across the economy as a whole.
We know that in some industrial sectors women represent the majority of workers, such as in textiles, garments and footwear, areas of the food industry, cork, cabling, and electrical and electronic equipment, whereas their participation in cutting-edge technology sectors is limited.
There is large-scale participation of women in industry and they make a substantial contribution in almost all sectors. Nonetheless, one has to agree with the rapporteur that the role of women in industries involving cutting-edge technologies, such as the aeronautical industry or the chemical industry, is very inadequate.
This will assist the European industry and research institutes in the development of new, cutting-edge ICT services, products and solutions to enhance the quality of life for the older persons.
I am also proud that my region has been at the cutting edge of assistive technologies - not just with a view to the elderly, but also technologies have been developed to help people with disabilities.
Were we in Europe expected to deprive ourselves of the chance to be at the cutting edge of technology?
However I will vote in favour of the report because its objective is to accelerate innovation in cutting edge European low carbon technologies.
So far so good, but that is not the full picture.
So far so good, but the reality is often quite different.
Although it has not been possible to carry out the analysis required (not forgetting that the devil is in the detail), my initial reactions are as follows:
However, as we well know, in these negotiations the devil is in the detail, and we met him during these negotiations on three particular points I would like to mention briefly.
Nevertheless, we will come to learn that the devil is in the detail.
We do not want to be like those who cannot see the wood for the trees, but, on the other hand, nor do we want to ignore the fact that sometimes the devil is in the detail.
As is often the case in politics, the devil is in the detail, and it is therefore important that we retain a balanced attitude towards these questions.
However, there is still a great deal of work to be done, because the devil is in the detail, for example on questions such as: who is a lobbyist?
Finally, and because sometimes the devil is in the detail, our task is to ensure, even in the more technical areas, that the legislation we produce always offers the best means of protection for our citizens.
Mr President, it can be a fine line between transparency and infringement of privacy.
There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry.
At the same time, however, we need to remember that in today's global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions, and that, at the end of the day, we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations.
There is a very fine line between freedom of speech and breaking the law.
At the same time, however, these figures and others like them show that conventional energy sources are inevitably going to play a major role in Europe's energy supply in the decades ahead, even if renewable energies gain ground.
For a country which overturned oligarchy back in 1917, it is quite incredible that a new autocracy is gaining ground, and we should not cut down our criticisms for fear of endangering a partnership which exists but on paper.
Clearly there still remains much to be done, but I feel that the process of raising awareness among people of the climate change issue is increasingly gaining ground because the effects can be seen every day, they are real and people can feel them.
In my experience, although many people feel a moral and political obligation to stop such extremist ideas from gaining ground, many stop short of specifically condemning it in a written statement or in another way.
I would like to remind you that in modern history, during periods when freedoms and rights were curbed in the name of security, policing and strict control, and when persecution based on stereotypes was allowed to gain ground, ideological bigotry, racism and xenophobia intensified and unspeakable crimes were committed.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, the car has of course been steadily gaining ground for a long time now.
Fundamentalist ideologies have clearly been gaining ground in recent years, even in key areas of government and parliament, and this poses a threat to the freedom of the press and media and, more particularly, to the hopes of Afghan women and girls for an equal role in society.
We should not lose touch with our local communities by trampling over their interests, or appearing so to do.
In my view, the 225 MEPs who voted to reject this directive were either driven by nationalist fanaticism or, at the very least, have lost touch with ordinary people's concerns!
Since the start of Annapolis, the European Union has lost its touch.
The former Goldman Sachs consultant and ex-President of the Commission may act like a former consultant of a multinational bank at times, but he does not intend to worry about the momentous consequences for Italian families - including those in the north - who are burdened by costs and who cannot make ends meet...
I should like to make it clear at this juncture that the people and government of Italy have a right to defend themselves, and that what has happened mainly goes to show that the Directive is unsuitable and that it must be made easier, not more difficult, to deport criminals - criminals, mark you, not decent people working to make ends meet.
It is difficult to explain to the European public why, for example, the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such as Heineken and Nestlé receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land, whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet.
We only need to talk to people, women in the home and pensioners anywhere in Europe, in Italy, France or wherever, to know that people are finding it hard to make ends meet.
Mr President, I trust, however, that Parliament will not succumb to the temptation to revive the already dead constitutional idea, because it would merely illustrate that it is an ivory tower.
I regard this directive as an example of ivory-tower bureaucracy, and I hope we can rectify this mistake quickly before any serious damage is inflicted on our agriculture.
There are essential decisions to be taken that are most fundamental to a whole society, and these decisions must be taken at the lowest possible level, as close as possible to citizens, and not in the ivory towers of Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg.
The European institutions are increasingly distrusted - quite rightly in my opinion, as it happens - by our citizens who do not accept that many very important decisions which directly affect their lives are made in ivory towers which are no longer monitored by any means or person.
Now that Signor Frattini has left the ivory towers of the EU and has a job in the real political world, he has changed his tune.
The deliberate decision to present the Lisbon Treaty in a form that is totally illegible to a lay person is, in this respect, a spectacular illustration of what I would call 'the ivory tower syndrome'.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during our last debate in July on access to medicines, I concluded my comments by calling on the Council and the Commission to make clear and formal commitments that would guarantee Europe's active involvement in finding new solutions and its desire to be a front runner in the fight for access to affordable medicines for everyone.
So there are rising protectionist threats, and not least when we hear the rhetoric from across the Atlantic from two of the front-runners in the presidential race.
Russia, Minister, is evolving into a closed society where the ruling regime would prefer not to allow anyone to look over its shoulders.
Has the Union got over its teething troubles with expansion in the east?
The Irish people will not get over their disillusionment.
If you take into account all of our coastal and outermost regions, we have got over 320 000 km of coastline, home to a third of our EU total population.
Finally, I cannot get over the fact that in 2007 Official Development Assistance from the whole of the EU fell for the first time since 2000.
I also think it is very important that we encourage the partial decommissioning proposed in the text because this will allow fishermen who really would love to continue fishing, who have the skills and the expertise of generations, to continue, albeit in a smaller way, while we get over the present economic crisis facing them.
The EU must bite the bullet.
His original intentions were laudable as he was trying to kill two birds with one stone: legalising poppy cultivation and opium production for medical purposes would not only have ended heroin production in Afghanistan but also the lack of painkillers worldwide.
Therefore we are in a very positive situation where we can kill two birds with one stone.
As the Commissioner said, it kills two birds with one stone.
I think we all have to get our act together.
If we do not get our act together, we cannot really be taken seriously by our international colleagues.
As one of the stakeholders said, 'The behaviour of the Council can be compared to the behaviour of a snail'; that is how slowly the Council has been moving on this subject whereas Parliament has finally got its act together.
I congratulate the Council for getting their act together and taking decisive action.
We have to get our act together.
China exchanges Chinese weapons for Sudanese oil, and it is not rocket science to see that this is one of the most important ways in which the ongoing conflict is being sustained.
Besides, it is not rocket science: vehicle manufacturers must recoup their design costs somewhere.
Some are given the benefit of the doubt and others are not, depending on their national or ethnic origin.
Nevertheless, we must give him the benefit of the doubt on his helpful comments about improving the rule of law, human rights and the fight against corruption - with the EU being more engaged in the strategic partnership and new PCA with what is still the largest country in the world, which now projects renewed confidence due to its mineral-resource-driven trillion-dollar economy.
As regards the protection of children, the report states that, in the event of uncertainty as to age, children should be given the benefit of the doubt.
You are burying your heads in the sand.
Nevertheless, the rapid growth of such technologies is outstripping our understanding of the potential occupational health risks: workers can be exposed to nanoparticles through inhalation, dermal contact and ingestion, and we cannot bury our heads in the sand and refuse to carry out research and assess whether there are any risks.
Of course, there will be those who say that change comes at too high a cost and that we have no choice but to bury our heads in the sand and hope for the best.
However, let us not bury our heads in the sand, as Europe itself has become much less secure precisely because of the open border policy that has been pursued.
To the Spanish Members who have alleged here in a particularly vigilant and occasionally even aggressive way that I am telling lies, I would say that they are really burying their heads in the sand.
Indeed, it is scandalous that when it comes to the risks associated with nanotechnology, the European Commission is still burying its head in the sand and is claiming that the current legislation in place is quite adequate.
The initial impetus in this direction was nipped in the bud on 13 May 2005, with brute force that claimed the lives of hundreds of demonstrators.
I wonder, however, whether they were so unexpected, and I applaud the fact that the Czech government started dealing with them early on, at Christmas, because the French Presidency had failed to nip them in the bud.
Bureaucracy must be nipped in the bud.
More than 200 Tibetans died, some as a result of deliberate fatal shots, and now - shortly after the 50th anniversary - monasteries are closed to the outside world, access roads are controlled and soldiers and security men stand in readiness to nip demonstrations in the bud.
The second experience which I would like to share with you is this: it is important not to become exhausted or disenchanted, and it is important not to lose heart.
However, civil society, NGOs, trade unions, business forums and think tanks will also have a very important role to play in implementing and monitoring the planned measures.
We have a think-tank where everybody is involved: they have discussions and exchange best practice and experiences.
This Summit also ought to approve the Euro-Latin American Foundation, a type of think tank for the development of bi-regional relations, and give our relationship some much-needed visibility, since regrettably it is not well known in Europe.
Also included in this opinion is reference to the need to develop common guidelines, exchange best practices, improve the use of available technology and involve think tanks and NGOs in order to better implement measures to reduce illegal fishing and the sale of illegal catches in European markets.
For one, lawyers and think-tanks that take part in lobbying activities are for all intents and purposes lobbyists and should therefore be registered.
We want to replace the word 'churches' with the word 'religious' so the phrase will go like this: '[...] should be considered lobbyists and treated in the same way: professional lobbyists, companies' in-house lobbyists, NGOs, think-tanks, trade associations, trade unions and employers' organisations, religious, philosophical and nonconfessional organisations [...]' and so on.
Is that its intention, or is this still entirely up in the air?
It is all still up in the air, which means that saying at this point that the Parliamentary assistants' allowance will help us solve every problem is simply a lie - and also a lie to the public.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the title of the Commission's communication and action plan on adult learning, 'It is never too late to learn', and its German title, Man lernt nie aus ('You live and learn'), are both universally familiar sayings, but when you read between the lines in the present context, they actually imply an acknowledgement of past omissions in the field of European education policy.
Let us hope that we shall all weigh up the dangers inherent in unilateral recognition and act with particular care, because unsuccessful manoeuvres might set off chain reactions in the wider region, with unforeseen consequences.
The unilateral declaration of Kosovo's independence will cause a chain reaction of destabilisation in the Western Balkans and a negative precedent for many international issues.
If relationships break down, it is all too easy to predict a series of chain reactions throughout the region, events that would eventually reach our borders.
It is the beginning of a chain reaction with important consequences.
Political will means regarding climate issues as an acid test for Europe and for a different type of globalisation.
This lunchtime we have the opportunity to pass this acid test and make it clear whether, for us, this is about patients' rights or whether we prefer the blinkered perspective of the national healthcare bureaucracies.
It is an opportunity for a new beginning with strong participation on the part of the elected representatives of the people, and the granting of discharge for the future President of the European Council is the first acid test.
The acid test of our commitment to human rights and the rule of law is our response to the Goldstone report, which found that the siege of Gaza is collective punishment of the population and that Operation Cast Lead was to further that policy.
In any case, those who propose this amendment are barking up the wrong tree, because it is the Member States that guarantee such arrangements.
The blame game will not do anyone any good.
We should not get into the blame game; we can all go back over what happened in Gaza over the last months, with the cynical exploitation by the Israeli authorities, cutting off water, power and food supplies to people, literally attempting to starve them into submission.
The blame game between the European institutions is getting us nowhere.
Tomorrow I think there is an opportunity for Parliament to show that we not only sing our own arias of regret and anger and play the blame game, but we can make a real contribution constructively to establish leadership and pick up on very concrete proposals that the European Commission could immediately initiate.
The report reveals how and where the chill of the economy and the rat race can be combated with social warmth.
That is the best of both worlds.
On the other hand, a form of privileged partnership would combine the best of both worlds.
This will lead to competition between states, regions and workers, where the law of the jungle holds sway.
We have had a few altercations with the Council but have held sway in the end.
Ladies and gentlemen, in a world where regional powers hold sway, the European Union must seize the unique opportunities represented by the new instruments of the Treaty to establish itself as a political power which is both more homogeneous, and therefore more able to make itself heard on the international stage, and firmer with its partners.
Certainly, throughout the world differing values hold sway.
Mr President, I believe you have had word that Commissioner Frattini will no longer perform his function as a Commissioner with effect from 14 March.
I do think though that the rapporteur, Mr Rack, has dealt with this issue well and has worded the text well with regard to the subsidiarity principle.
Under these circumstances, if, on all sides of this House, we are willing to take action to defend what we call the democratic values of the European Union, then we must issue a solemn warning and, Commissioner, we must enforce European law as you have worded it, and say, together with the thousands of Italian intellectuals, creators and journalists, that the freedom to inform and the freedom to be informed must be respected unconditionally in Italy as in the whole of the European Union.
Two cases caught the attention of public opinion: a 13-year old boy in Civitavecchia, near Rome, who was taken to the emergency room after being beaten by an Italian friend;
This is adding insult to injury, as they say.
Adoption of amendments that play down the environmental threats will, frankly speaking, add insult to injury.
We can already see signs of Member States looking for ways to cut corners and costs on last year's political commitments, even though the Stern report of 2006 warned that the costs of action now will be far less than the costs of inaction later.
There is always a temptation during these difficult times to exploit those who are less able to defend themselves, to cut corners when it comes to regulation designed precisely to protect against such exploitation.
The European Union should keep tabs on China's expansion in Africa.
And it is not being done because it is a harder nut to crack.
This is, of course, our bread and butter.
Rather, this argument goes, the European Union's job is to focus on bread-and-butter issues like employment or trade.
It is crucial that we do not pull the plug on community and voluntary groups that are engaged in this valuable work.
On 13 May a mob of approximately 60 people used Molotov cocktails to set fire to five Romany camps in Naples.
If we do not pass this test, the flames in Naples will set fire to all Europe.
This was followed by a round-up of Roma, instead of arresting those who set fire to the Romany camps in Italy.
It is inadmissible to fingerprint European citizens and, especially, children, it is not normal to set fire to camps installed, with the tacit consent of the authorities.
Let us take heart from the fact that it took 3 000 years for it to be accepted that the Earth is a globe and not flat.
As Geoffrey van Orden has said, there are no negotiations going on so we should not take heart from the current situation.
Many Member States have different approaches, but all of them should take heart from the themes and the direction that he has outlined.
Madam President, it is general knowledge that major football championships are a source of great pleasure and fun for audiences and supporters, but this is nevertheless a problem that constitutes a dark side to the events, to which attention must be devoted, and not just in terms of words; after all, to quote a well-known Dutch football song: 'geen woorden maar daden' [actions speak louder than words].
We have already heard from Sweden about the problem of pieces of cake being served in the back of the church.
The Commissioner has heard my colleagues say that if the Council and Parliament approve this text, the ball is in its court.
Now the ball is in the court of the Polish authorities.
Consequently we have not just the possibility of pulling our weight against the Council; we have a duty to do so.
In short, can the Commission look at any steps to deal with that potential inequity in countries where there are regional governments which might be pulling their weight and national governments which are not?
It is notably the eurosceptic countries that are pulling their weight: the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands to a great extent.
We must go back to the drawing board and lay new foundations for the European project so that it responds to the crises currently facing us - financial crisis, food crisis, energy crisis - but also responds to the considerable problems we must tackle.
I think the Commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal, one that is not just about supporting performers and artists, but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that.
Like many of my fellow Members, I think that the European Commission and the Member States must go back to the drawing board, work on the 'rosé wine' designation, and ensure that the name 'rosé' is exclusively reserved for wines produced using traditional methods, whether in the European Union or in third countries.
I say this with all the respect that I have had for the work that you have done in recent years: we are arguing here about what is the right position to take and it is cowardly on your part - just because your Group has stabbed you in the back, and all over a subtly different position that also states that we need troops, but we need to do it properly - to simply duck your head and say that you are withdrawing your name.
Mr President, I do not let Israel off the hook but it is extremely unhelpful for the European Parliament to single out one party - Israel - in a complex conflict where human rights abuses demand a balanced approach.
As a rule of thumb we can assume that the smaller the enterprise, the heavier the relative burden of administrative costs.
Each traveller on this gravy train can tell his electorate whatever he likes in their own language without fear that they will overhear what his colleagues in other states are telling their electors.
The image which our voters have of the European institutions, and we should be well aware of this, is one of a gravy train where overpaid and undertaxed apparatchiks and MEPs form a kind of Soviet-styled nomenclature, where decisions are often taken over the heads of the public, and certainly against the will and the interest of the citizens.
But no one is out of the woods yet.
It is overcoming it, although we are not yet out of the woods.
However, neither Greece nor the eurozone are completely out of the woods yet as there are still concerns regarding financial stability in the euro area.
In my opinion, the proposal on data protection fails to offer the intended protection, and the Council is on thin ice with its extension of the framework decision.
The belief is that we have this silver bullet which will change everything.
There is no silver bullet here.
In the same vein, tackling climate change is a long-term matter, and there is no silver bullet or simple solution.
It is in this context that I would float the idea of looking into setting up a global public instrument for assessing States.
The euro area ended 2007 almost breaking even - for the first time in its history, with a deficit of 0.6-0.7% - but this means that we now have sufficient flexibility so that our fiscal policy can really help to sustain demand, as our monetary policy should also do.
However, the promises made within the framework of external action are the last straw in terms of the lack of realism.
That would be the last straw, in any case.
To make matters worse, those Czechs have a popular president with a disagreeably sharp intellect who not only opposes the Treaty of Lisbon, but can competently call attention to the ever-widening democratic deficit in the Union.
To make matters worse, the Commission and Parliament are now discussing a tolerable risk of error.
The objectives of the Lisbon Strategy should not be put on ice.
According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice - as opposed to cancelled.
(HU) The internationally-renowned Roşia Montană Gold Corporation, a Canadian-Romanian joint venture, is planning to develop Europe's largest open-pit gold mine in the Transylvanian town of Verespatak (Roşia Montană).
Let me also point out that Member States are responsible for deciding on whether to open gold mines on their territories.
With regard to the current investment at Roşia Montană, the plans involve an exponentially larger gold mine.
When I asked the Commission about the creation of cyanide-based gold mines in Bulgaria, the Commission's reply increased my fears and the need for this legislation to be stricter and to be applied more decisively.
