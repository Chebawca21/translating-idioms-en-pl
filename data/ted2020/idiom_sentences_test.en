I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues, and also fossil fuels, there is no one silver bullet.
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech, let me tell you this: the payload is rocket science.
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS -- now that's rocket science.
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
And by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.
Well that's rocket science; that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.
What we're talking about today is also rocket science.
(Laughter) Now, none of this is rocket science.
And to make a long story short, in the last couple of years now, thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East, enjoying the hospitality of the people there.
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
To make a long story short, I said, "So you need me to get back in there?"
And as a result, once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice, they accepted me.
And just when you think these stories are fading into history, and that we've gotten over them, they pop up in the strangest places.
You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace, or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams.
(Laughter) And once you get over the backhanded nature of that, there was actually something very profound there.
who I've got over.
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole?
And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence, to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears, you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue, fiber, DNA, what makes a great piece of music great.
I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.
My call to action today is that we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives.
We need to get over it so we can move beyond it, and our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives, more than money and power and titles and influence.
After he got over his surprise at being, you know, turned down, he concluded he'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person.
A few years later, I was invited to be the director of the museum, and after I got over that -- "Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" -- I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that curated museum experience.
So he got over to the runway, and he applied the power.
And Andrew said to me, as we got over the training area, "You see that mountain over there?"
Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks.
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
He tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."
SP: All right, let's get over to that site.
Then we have our Bud Light guy who's the happy couch potato.
Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes.
"The Eldorado of the United States of America: the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."
All of these girls went to the gold mine, and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things.
Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is.
A concept that my 75-year-old mother just can't seem to wrap her head around.
Now try and wrap your head around that for a second.
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets, and the more dust you would have going up in the air, on the white paper you can almost see, but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker.
"And, baby," I'll tell her, don't keep your nose up in the air like that.
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air, going at hundreds of miles an hour, and you're trying to drop an object, a bomb, towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments.
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock, and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.
They're throwing it up in the air.
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to, and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video) So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising.
You know, a fine line between madness and genius.
And so just to return to my son, when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder, and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today, and I asked him for permission -- granted.
And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing.
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all that I stood up and I walked around to where she was sitting so that I could look over her shoulder and verify what was written on the page in front of her.
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life, are things that are deeper, things we don't really even have words for.
We didn't have words like "crowdsourcing" and "radical collaboration" when I had my accident.
And what we caught, we didn't have words for it.
And I set up Kanchi, because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant, because disability is like the elephant in the room.
There's one last elephant in the room: the proteins themselves, which come from algae, bacteria and funguses and all over the tree of life.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room, but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.
Maybe it was a poem, maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.
I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics.
Now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance.
I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject.
And one of the the cutting-edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy.
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider.
I work to find ways that cutting-edge technologies like this can help make the unseen seeable, to see marine bacteria in action and learn how they behave.
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan to startups in Silicon Valley.
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
This is really the tip of the iceberg.
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
It represents a colossal waste of food, but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg.
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.
And this was very surprising to me, because I've gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments I decided not to do -- and I never got this guilt trip to this extent.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.
This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet, threw up enough dust to block out the sun.
The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it, and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles.
In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise, because it woke us up to the dangers of these things.
Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet.
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there.
These days I'm buying the $1.99 trial-size jug of Tide to make ends meet.
That's a really long time to make ends meet if you are broke.
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together, it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world.
I suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together.
As a simple rule of thumb, just imagine that every time you're telling a good versus evil story, you're basically lowering your IQ by ten points or more.
As a good rule of thumb, if you're asking: "When I hear a story, when should I be especially suspicious?"
So now I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb.
They're only rules of thumb, so of course they don't apply to everything, but this is how you can generalize.
So with a little bit of molecular eye candy, (Laughter) we've got kinesins, the orange ones.
So our doctors said these are eye candies.
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."
Well it doesn't break even.
(Laughter) (Applause) And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs.
I mean, after all, aging is not a piece of cake.
I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges.
Well some researchers lost heart, concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each giving rise to different physical features, string theory would never make definitive, testable predictions.
There are over 500 think tanks.
I'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world for amazing case studies."
And I've just started a three-year think tank for autism.
In Washington, in think tanks, where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas, you don't get bold new ideas, because if you offer up a bold new idea, not only are you attacked on Twitter, but you will not get confirmed in a government job.
But if we're going with the flow, if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong, but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy, to actually save some energy to move forward.
Number four: Go with the flow.
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.
An "are you with us or against us?" stance takes root.
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled, and they came up with another plan: We don't sell you the phone, we don't sell you the monthly plan.
So because we tested it with wheelchair users, with wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them, not just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions, and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design, which we brought back to East Africa in '09 that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain, but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big, it was heavy, it was hard to move around, so again with that user feedback, we went back to the drawing board, came up with a better design, 20 pounds lighter, as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested that in a field trial in Guatemala, and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it's going into production.
So, we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field.
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.
30-year-olds predicted they’d still have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds had lost touch with theirs.
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.
This is when a layer is made up of very, very cold water droplets, and in one region they start to freeze, and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below, giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.
Every school was a big top circus tent, and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers, from clowns to carnies, all of these miles ahead of who we were.
And there's this Flaubert quote that I love: "I have always tried to live in an ivory tower, but a tide of shit is beating at its walls, threatening to undermine it."
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years we have come out of our ivory tower, and started to publish ex ante -- and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" — before the crash confirmed the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game.
She remembered, for example, when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital, and she had a lot of x-rays, and two of them were leg x-rays, which made sense, but six of them were chest x-rays, which didn't.
Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology.
But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground, it's gaining respectability.
So far so good?
When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.
But the acid test is always going to be, how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes.
Although there are that many genes, there is some method to the madness.
And then the story changed when the situation at the power plant in Fukushima got out of hand.
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
You know, the whole nine yards.
Generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science.
This isn't a matter of buying a fair-trade peach and calling it a day, buying a guilt-free zone with your money.
Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later.
To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls.
Just as a grandfather clock relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition between two energy levels of an atom.
And then I got wind of the fact that in Egypt, they were using this term "mutabi’," which means "to follow."
The Pharaoh got wind of this -- This is true, right off the Internet.
Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg just does not make a dozen.
It's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."
I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him, do psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.
We were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually.
So I took heart in seeing that.
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
